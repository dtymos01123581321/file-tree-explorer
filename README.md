Create a simple file explorer component that consists of two panes:
![demo 2024-08-04 03-19-26.gif](demo%202024-08-04%2003-19-26.gif)

- Folder hierarchy on the left pane
- File list and document view on the right pane

Use the Windows or Mac file explorers for reference.

Minimal functionality:

- Expand/collapse folders in the left pane
- Double-click a folder to list its contents in the right pane.
    - Indicate which folder is active on the left pane.
- Double-click a file (plain text or image) to see its contents on the right pane.
- Must support png and plain text files (can use mock data)

Implementation:

- Must use React, Typescript preferred
- Does not need backend, can use mocked/local data, and public image urls
